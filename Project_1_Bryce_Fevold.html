    <h2> Questions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3>
        <li>What was your first impression of this site?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>It was simple, only 3 seperate links. I enjoy the colors but not many options on the main page.</p>
        
        <h3>
        <li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links
            on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li>
        </h3>
            <p>The site has 3 text bnoxes that link to different pages with additional links to different related websites.</p>
        
        <h3>
        <li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>Its so simple it cant be confusing, however theres not many options to return to the home page or to manipulate between the differnet links</p>
        
        <h3>
        <li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from
            it? Why?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>It enhances it, not by much but at least its not blank information. The font and art/collor is aesthetically pleasing.</p>
        
        <h3>
        <li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time
            reasonable?</li>
        </h3>    
        <p>Very quickly. Not a lot of data or info to have to display.</p>
        
        <h3>
        <li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or
            image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li>
        </h3>    
        <p>Easily readable. The subtext to the links on the following pagers is small and not outlined or bolded so it's not as easy to read but very minimal.</p>
        
        <h3>
        <li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the
            navigation well done?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>Just 3 links. NO forward or back/return. That was not very pleasing. A master link to the home page would be nice.</p>
        
        <h3>    
        <li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all
            the pages?</li>
        </h3>    
        <p>Yes. Vertical list of links on each following page.</p>
        
        <h3>    
        <li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>It adjusts accordingly and due to the information being centered it never gets lost on the borders. The text wraps nicely.</p>
        
        <h3>
        <li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>At the top of the page is a link to a group sign in account to purchase what they are offering. That was convenient to see on all pages. Higlighted in green and black text to read easily. Not too large or in your face yet easy to find.</p>
